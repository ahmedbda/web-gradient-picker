## Project purpose
This project was made to work on my web development skills 

It made me discover and work with basic dynamic state control with React as well as learn to compose styles quickly, implement responsive design and configure custom themes for colors and utilities with Tailwind  

## Available gradients
The application comes with five uniquely designed color themes, all gradient color codes from [Schemecolor](https://www.schemecolor.com/)
